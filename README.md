webber
======

Python based static website generator like IkiWiki. Fork of http://gitorious.org/webber
Webber is a static web-site generation tool, loosely based on ideas from IkiWiki and my own likings.

It works by ...

reading one configuration file
reading one or more page files
considering any number of plugins
execution of macros
execution of hooks
rendering through a template, using functions
Finally webber creates static HTML files that you can upload to your web-site. I recommend sitecopy for this.
